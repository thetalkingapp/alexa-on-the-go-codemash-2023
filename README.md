Alexa On-the-Go
===
This repo contains code from Craig Walls' session on building mobile Alexa skills, presented at CodeMash 2023.

The skill ID and Lambda ARNs have been scrubbed from this project. To use it, you'll need to create your own Alexa skill and then copy the relevant code bits on top of your skill.
